# My algorithm practice implementations in Python:
  This repository is mainly for algorithm and data structures implementations in python, I'm still learning and practicing.
  This repository is constantly evolving as I improve and explore more topics...

## Folder structure:
- Sorting algorithms
- Recursion
- Trees
- Graphs
- Search algorithms
- Advanced Data Structures
- Dynamic Programming
- etc...

## Goals:
- Build a deeper understanding in CS core topics.
- Document my learning journey.

## Notes:
- This is mainly for self study and tracking my growth. If you're also learning or have any suggestions, feel free to tell me!
